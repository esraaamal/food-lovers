    <h2>  What Is the Most Popular Food in the World?  </h2>
    <p>
       
     Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soy-based soup made from a stock called dashi, miso paste, and various additional ingredients such as seaweed or tofu. It is estimated that more than 70% of Japenese people consume the soup for breakfast, although it is commonly available at any time of the day.

In Japanese restaurants in the United States,
 miso soup is often offered as an appetizer.
  The soup is thought to have medicinal properties, 
  as it alkalizes the blood and revives the nervous system.
   The main ingredient is called miso - a combination of rice, salt,
    water, and fermented soybeans, shaped into a paste that is similar to peanut butter in texture.

Miso is centuries old, and its roots are in chiang - a fermented soybean paste invented in China by Buddhist priests more than 2500 years ago. Since miso soup is relatively quick and easy to prepare, in Japan, there are even instant cups of the soup available in vending machines for a small amount of money, acting as a testament to the soup's enormous popularity.
